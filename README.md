# A-singly-Linked-Circular-List-for-dbs
A singly linked circular list that was created for dbs encapsulation of node by filling elements and traversal in forward direction and counting the number of elements in the list is done.
When i created this, i did so with th purpose of creating a linked list that would act as a collection of nodes that together form a linear ordering. 

It takes many different forms and implementation. In its simplest form, a singly linked list is a linked list where each node is an object that stores a reference, and/or reference data values to an element and a reference, called "next", to another node. Note that a node is defined in terms of itself, which is called self-referential structure.

Using  the Circlist() procedure , I have chosen to insert the current data value. If else condition statement is used to check the inserted data is the value of next data. If the condition is true, then it will execute the statement. 

Otherwise, if the condition is false then execute the else statement and assign the value of ‘temp’ variable to ‘nextdata’ variable.

The Deldata() procedure is used to delete the nodes in the list. If condition statement is used to check the value of ‘nextdata’ and the ‘current data’ values are equal. If the condition is true then execute the statement.

Inside the Traverse() procedure if condition statement is used to check the value of ‘node’ variable is equal to null. If the condition is true then execute the statement. This will be done while loop is used to check the value of node is not equal to the value of ‘snode’ variable. If the condition is true then execute the iteration of the loop.

This is how it goes with a singly linked circular list!
